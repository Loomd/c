//Unit 6 Programming Assignment 9 - Age in Seconds.
//Write a program that accepts a personâ€™s s name and age in years, then prints the number of seconds the person has lived.
//Use a posttest loop to repeat this process until the user indicates there are no more cases to process
//Use another posttest loop to put an error trap around the age entry to be sure the user enters an age that is at least 0.
