// Fizz Buzz - (from codecademy) is a classic developer interview question that is asked or referred to so often for so long, it is almost a clich√©!
// Though this challenge will appear very simplistic to those with some coding experience, it is designed to weed out 99.5% programming job candidates
// who cannot creatively use their coding knowledge to solve simple problems.
